            <p> The Covid-19, Coronavirus disease 2019, has impacted
                the people all over the globe. Students have had to 
                take to online classes and teachers find new methods
                of engaging children, some people lose jobs, and some
                just have to stay at home and work.

                    As with most teaching methods, online learning also has 
                    its own set of positives and negatives. Decoding and 
                    understanding these positives and negatives will help 
                    institutes in creating strategies for more efficient 
                    delivery of the lessons, ensuring an uninterrupted learning 
                    journey for the students.

                    With this sudden shift away from the classroom in many parts 
                    of the globe, some are wondering whether the adoption of online 
                    learning will continue to persist post-pandemic, and how such a 
                    shift would impact the worldwide education market.

                    About 450 million or roughly 90% of Indiaâ€™s population works in the 
                    unorganised economy (6). These include mostly the poor, daily wagers, 
                    construction workers, street vendors, landless laborers, petty traders, 
                    tailors, barbers, cycle rickshaw/auto-rickshaw/taxi/Ola/Uber drivers 
                    and the homeless. The main source of the livelihood of these daily 
                    wagers was severely compromised due to the lockdown, causing massive 
                    disturbance to their livings.

                    More than one in 10 people aged 16 - 25 have lost their job, and just 
                    under six in 10 have seen their earnings fall since the coronavirus 
                    pandemic began, new research shows. The study found young workers 
                    to be twice as likely to have lost their jobs compared to older 
                    employees. The self-employed and those who grew up in a poor family.
                    The survey, carried out by academics from the London School of 
                    Economics and Political Science (LSE) and Exeter University, provides 
                    further evidence that young people are suffering substantial and 
                    sustained losses, not only to their employment, but also their 
                    education.

                    Older adults are at greater risk of requiring hospitalization or dying 
                    if they are diagnosed with COVID-19. As you get older, your risk of 
                    being hospitalized for COVID-19 increases.Everyone should take steps 
                    to prevent getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to 
                    protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased 
                    risk of severe illness.Masks offer some protection to you and are also 
                    meant to protect those around you, in case you are unknowingly infected 
                    with the virus that causes COVID-19.
